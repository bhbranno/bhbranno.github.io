I have always had a desire to learn programming. When I was working as bank teller a couple years ago, a friend and I decided to teach ourselves to code and create our own website. Although this endeavor ultimately failed, I did gain a basic knowledge of html, css, and javascript and it stuck with me that coding was enjoyable and the career potential was huge. I initally entered college as an accounting major and after a couple accounting classes, I realized that was not for me and remembered how much I enjoyed coding. I decided to switch to MIS since I already had most of my business classes completed and didn't want to start all over to major in computer science. I hope to use the skills I learn in pursuit of a MIS degree to create my own business one day.
