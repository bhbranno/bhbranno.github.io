The last WOD was Invoice1, which required you to use javascript to create a invoice of various products and their prices.

When performing this WOD, I noticed the thing I struggle with the most was syntax. I had to restart the WOD once because I could not remember how to type out the toFixed when trying to round the sales tax to two decimal places. What worked surprisingly well though, was using the string template. I thought I would have messed up more typing that stuff out, or missed a parentheses or something somewhere but it all came together well.

I prepared the same for this WOD as I have for previous ones. I attempted the entire WOD first before recording, then when I got to a place where I was stuck, I skipped to that part in the solution screencast, and then continued trying to do the rest on my own. I don't think I will do much differently next time because this method helps me figure out what I know, and quickly fill in the blanks of what I don't know. I don't have to spend forever trying to get a good recording under the Rx time.
